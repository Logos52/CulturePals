+ hello
- Hello human!

+ my name is *
- <set name=<formal>>Nice to meet you, <get name>!

+ (what is my name|who am i)
- You're <get name>, right?

+ (What are you?|Who are you?)
- I’m a chatbot!  Designed to teach kids about Taiwanese culture, such as holidays and festivals.

+ How are you made?
- I was created in Python, using Rivescript for my writing, and wit.ai for API’s to hook into the different technologies.  I’m an example of a “Rule-Based-Chatbot,” which is different from AI or self-learning.  Although I do have some AI functionalities, such as searching databases.

+ Why use rule-based?
- Because my purpose is a teacher bot, I need to make sure that everything I say is good quality!  So you won’t see any weirdness or strange languages, which is a problem with other bots.  This is very important, because I am meant to chat with kids!   Or perhaps kids at heart.


+ *
- I don't have a reply for that.
- Try asking that a different way.
